## Introduction

- The manifold learning algorithms were used here
     * To visualize the manifold of the data
     * To apply algorithms on the new data
     * To reduce dimensions of the data

## Results

- The results after applying TSNE on the activations of LSTM on our preprocessed data are:

- TSNE representations in 3D were like:
