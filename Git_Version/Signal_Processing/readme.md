## Introduction

- The signal processing related stuff was done here
- Looking at peaks and their features etc
- From these features, the new preprocessed dataset is made.
- All the good results are on that preprocessed data.

## Preprocessing

- We found peaks of different heights and widths that can separate alcoholics and control people
- We came up with these thresholds
    * 0<height<15
    * 3<width<8

## Results

-The number of such peaks were found in almost each channel more in alcoholics than control people
