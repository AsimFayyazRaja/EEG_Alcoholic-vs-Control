## Introduction

- WGANs will be used here to generate more samples of EEG
    * Can be used for data augmentation
    * Understanding relation of latent space with the different aspects of EEG signal
    
- So far normalization has done and training is also done, but the results are not that much good.

- The original and normalized signal of the EEG is shown below
